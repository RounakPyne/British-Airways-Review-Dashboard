* # About Dataset

British Airways, one of the world's leading airlines, has been synonymous with excellence and reliability for decades. With a rich history and a commitment to providing exceptional customer experiences, British Airways continues to be a preferred choice for travelers worldwide.

As part of a challenging and rewarding data science project at British Airways, I had the opportunity to work on web scraping review data from the renowned Skytrax website. The goal was to collect valuable insights from customer reviews and leverage data-driven approaches to enhance the airline's services and customer satisfaction.

The dataset comprises the following columns, each providing essential information extracted from the reviews:

**Reviews**: This column contains the text-based feedback and reviews provided by customers after their experience with British Airways.

**Date**: The date on which the review was posted by the customer, offering valuable temporal information.

**Stars**: The rating given by the traveler, typically on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, reflecting their overall satisfaction with the airline's services.

**Type of Traveler**: This column categorizes the type of traveler who left the review, distinguishing between different travel demographics, such as business travelers, families, or solo adventurers.

**Type of Seat**: Provides insights into the type of seat the traveler experienced during their flight, including economy, premium economy, business, or first class.

**Country**: Indicates the country of origin of the customer, allowing for regional analysis and understanding customer preferences.

**Recommended**: A binary indicator that reflects whether the traveler would recommend British Airways based on their experience.

**Route**: This column provides information about the specific route or flight taken by the passengers, offering context to their reviews and experiences.
